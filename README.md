# Rick and Morty infinite scrolling app

## Abute

This is a small and fun React application that I built in order to learn and implement the use of React-query, and actually also MaterialUI.

The app displays a gallery of characters from the "Rick and Morty" universe, including a photo and basic information. As you scroll down the screen, more and more characters are loaded so that an "infinite scrolling" effect is created. There are about 800 figures in total (about 40 additional "pages" beyond the initial display).
